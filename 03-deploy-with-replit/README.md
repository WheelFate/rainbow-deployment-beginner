# 🚀 Deploying the Apps Using Replit

In this project, we avoided offline tools completely and used **Replit** to host all versions of our app.

### ☁️ What We Did:

- We created simple apps using the "HTML, CSS, JS (Static)" template on [Replit](https://replit.com).
- Each app (v1, v2, v3) runs immediately when you click **Run**
- Each Repl gives you a **public link** that you can share and use in your router

💡 Replit is perfect for beginners because:
- No setup needed
- No terminal
- Free hosting with a shareable link
