# 🎓 How Rainbow Deployment Works

Rainbow Deployment is a modern deployment strategy that allows you to run **multiple versions of your app at the same time**, splitting traffic between them however you want.

This technique is useful for:

- 🧪 A/B testing
- 🚀 Rolling out features slowly
- 🛡 Safe rollback if something breaks
- 🔄 Real user feedback across versions

---

## 🧠 How Traffic Is Routed

Here’s a simple traffic split example:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[User Request] -->|50%| V1[Version 1 🌱];
  A -->|30%| V2[Version 2 🚀];
  A -->|20%| V3[Version 3 🦄];
