## 🌈 Try the Rainbow Deployment Now!

We’ve built a simple routing page that randomly redirects users to one of the deployed app versions (v1, v2, or v3), simulating live traffic in a real Rainbow Deployment.

🔀 **Try it here**:  
👉 [Rainbow Traffic Router](https://replit.com/@iamdakheel/rainbow-router)

🧠 How it works:
- 50% chance → Version 1  
- 30% chance → Version 2  
- 20% chance → Version 3

### ⚠️ Replit Preview Issue

> If you run the router inside Replit and see a message like  
> "**replit.com refused to connect**", don’t worry!
> 
> Just click **"Open in a new tab"** – it works perfectly there.  
> (Redirects don’t work in Replit’s preview pane due to browser security.)
