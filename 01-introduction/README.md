# 🧠 Introduction to Rainbow Deployment

Welcome! 👋

Before we learn *how* to do Rainbow Deployment, let’s first understand **what deployment strategies are**, and why Rainbow Deployment is **so useful** — especially in modern DevOps.

---

## 🚨 What's a Deployment Strategy?

A **deployment strategy** is *how* you release new versions of your software to users without breaking things.

---

## 🔵 Common Strategies

### 🔹 Blue-Green Deployment
- Two environments (Blue & Green)
- You switch traffic between them when ready
- Simple, but only supports 2 versions at a time

### 🐤 Canary Deployment
- Slowly roll out a new version to a small % of users
- Monitor for issues before going 100%

### 🌈 Rainbow Deployment
> **Many versions are deployed at once**, and traffic is split between them

- Like Blue-Green **but with more “colors” or versions**
- Great for complex rollouts, A/B testing, or phased releases
- Easy to roll back specific versions
- Gives more flexibility and safety 🚀
